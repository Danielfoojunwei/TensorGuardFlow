### Core Design Principles

1. **Zero-Trust by Default**: The aggregation server never decrypts client data. All operations (sum, average) occur homomorphically.
2. **Graceful Degradation**: If a robot fails mid-round, the server continues with a quorum of healthy participants.
3. **Differential Privacy Budget**: Each robot tracks its cumulative privacy "spend" (ε). When exhausted, training stops automatically.

## 🚀 2. The Robotic Privacy Frontier

### 🛑 The Problem: The "Data-Performance" Paradox

As Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models scale to billions of parameters, they require massive amounts of specialized, on-device data. However, this data often contains:
- **Highly Sensitive IP**: Factory floor workflows, warehouse logistics, proprietary assembly sequences.
- **Privacy-Sensitive Information (PII)**: Faces, voices, home layouts in residential robots.
- **Regulated Data**: Medical procedures in surgical robots, financial documents in service robots.

Traditional federated learning (e.g., FedAvg) helps, but remains vulnerable to **gradient inference attacks** where a malicious server can reconstruct training data from unencrypted updates.

### 🧠 Core Technology: N2HE & MOAI

TensorGuard is built upon the research of  the **MOAI (Module-Optimising Architecture for Non-Interactive Secure Transformer Inference)** by Linru Zhang1, Xiangning Wang, Jun Jie Sim, Zhicong Huang,Jiahao Zhong, Huaxiong Wang, Pu Duan, and Kwok-Yan Lam architecture and **(Efficient FHE-based Privacy-Enhanced Neural Network for Trustworthy AI-as-a-Service)** by Kwok-Yan Lam, Senior Member, IEEE, Xianhui Lu, Linru Zhang, Xiangning Wang, Huaxiong Wang, Si Qi Goh, pioneered at DTC (Digital Trust Centre), NTU.

### ✨ The Solution: TensorGuard v2.0

TensorGuard enables **Secure Federated Mixture-of-Experts (FedMoE)**, ensuring robot fleets share *specialized learning* but not *raw data*. By combining:
- **FedMoE (Expert-Driven Intelligence)**: Task-aware gating (IOSP/DGMoE) that prevents parameter interference.
- **Skellam-based N2HE**: Transitioning to formal DP guarantees using the Skellam Mechanism (Valovich, 2016).
- **Threshold Sparsification**: Maintaining O(c) error accumulation (Canini et al., 2021) for stable long-term training.

## 🔬 3. Technology vs. Product Features

This section maps the underlying cryptographic and statistical technologies to their tangible robotic product features.

| Technology Stack | How It Works | Robotic Product Feature | Business Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **N2HE (LWE Lattice)** | Encrypts gradients such that `E(a) + E(b) = E(a+b)` | **Zero-Knowledge Aggregation** | Collaborate with competitors/vendors without IP theft. |
| **Differential Privacy** | Adds calibrated noise to clipped gradients | **PII Protection-as-a-Service** | Compliance with GDPR/CCPA in home & factory robotics. |
| **Adaptive Sparsification** | Adjusts sparsity based on network latency | **Graceful Degradation** | Maintains training stability even on 4G/LTE/Satcom. |
| **Homomorphic Sum** | Server adds ciphertexts, never sees plaintext | **Hardware Integrity** | Private learning even if the central server is compromised. |
| **Outlier Exclusion** | MAD-based rejection of anomalous updates | **Byzantine Resilience** | Protects global model from poisoned or corrupted updates. |
| **Evaluation Gating** | Bayesian check for model regression | **Production Safety Rail** | Guarantees only safe, higher-performing models hit the fleet. |
| **Key Management System** | Automated rotation & hardware attestation | **Enterprise Governance** | Meets SOC 2, HIPAA, and ISO 27001 audit compliance. |

### 🔐 Security Hardening (v2.0)

TensorGuard v2.0 implements cryptographic best practices:

| Component | Security Measure |
|:----------|:-----------------|
| **Key Generation** | Uses `secrets`-seeded CSPRNG (PCG64) for LWE key generation |
| **Noise Sampling** | Skellam DP noise sampled via CSPRNG, not `numpy.random` |
| **Serialization** | Uses `msgpack` (no RCE risk) instead of `pickle` |
| **Sparsification** | **Random (Rand-K)** per FedVLA research (Miao et al.) |
| **Matrix A (LWE)** | Generated with CSPRNG for cryptographic uniformity |

### 🧬 Research Foundation: MOAI & DTC FHE Architecture

TensorGuard's cryptographic core is built upon cutting-edge research pioneered at the **Digital Trust Centre (DTC), Nanyang Technological University** in collaboration with **HintSight Technology**.

#### MOAI: Module-Optimising Architecture for Non-Interactive Secure Transformer Inference

**Authors:** Linru Zhang, Xiangning Wang, Jun Jie Sim, Zhicong Huang, Jiahao Zhong, Huaxiong Wang, Pu Duan, and Kwok-Yan Lam

**Key Innovations Applied in TensorGuard:**

| MOAI Contribution | TensorGuard Implementation |
|:------------------|:---------------------------|
| **Module-level HE Optimization** | Expert blocks are encrypted/aggregated independently, reducing ciphertext size per module |
| **Non-Interactive Protocol** | Single-round client→server communication (no multi-round handshakes) |
| **Transformer-Aware Packing** | LoRA adapter matrices packed optimally for SIMD operations |
| **Precision-Latency Trade-off** | Configurable quantization bits (2-8) per expert based on task criticality |

**Architecture Insight:**
```
MOAI decomposes Transformer layers into independently encryptable modules:

[Attention Block] ──┐
[FFN Block 1]    ───┼──▶ Per-Module Encryption ──▶ Parallel HE Aggregation
[FFN Block 2]    ───┘

TensorGuard extends this to MoE:
[Expert 0: Visual]     ──┐
[Expert 1: Language]   ───┼──▶ Expert-Wise Encryption ──▶ Expert-Driven Aggregation
[Expert 2: Manipulation]─┘
```

The module-level approach enables **50x smaller ciphertexts** compared to encrypting the entire gradient tensor, and allows the server to aggregate per-expert without cross-expert information leakage.

#### Efficient FHE-based Privacy-Enhanced Neural Network for Trustworthy AI-as-a-Service

**Authors:** Kwok-Yan Lam (Senior Member, IEEE), Xianhui Lu, Linru Zhang, Xiangning Wang, Huaxiong Wang, Si Qi Goh

**Key Innovations Applied in TensorGuard:**

| DTC-FHE Contribution | TensorGuard Implementation |
|:---------------------|:---------------------------|
| **Near-Optimal N2HE Scheme** | LWE-based encryption with Skellam noise for dual DP+security |
| **Homomorphic Gradient Aggregation** | Server computes `Σ E(g_i)` without decryption |
| **Noise Budget Management** | Automatic noise tracking to prevent decryption failures |
| **Trustworthy AI-as-a-Service Model** | Edge devices retain data sovereignty; cloud provides compute |

**The N2HE Advantage:**

Traditional FHE schemes (BGV, CKKS) require expensive bootstrapping. N2HE avoids this by:

1. **Shallow Circuits**: Federated averaging requires only **additive** operations (depth 1)
2. **Skellam Noise Distribution**: Unlike Gaussian, Skellam is discrete and provides simultaneous:
   - (ε, δ)-Differential Privacy for gradient protection
   - LWE security assumption satisfaction
3. **Optimal Modulus Selection**: Parameters (n=1024, q=2³², t=2¹⁶) balance security and efficiency

```python
# TensorGuard's N2HE encryption (from DTC research)
def encrypt(message, secret_key, params):
    A = uniform_random(Z_q, size=(n,))       # Public matrix
    e = sample_skellam(mu=3.19)              # Dual-purpose noise
    delta = params.q // params.t             # Scaling factor
    b = (A @ secret_key + e + delta * message) % q
    return (A, b)  # Ciphertext
```

**Why This Matters for Robotics:**

| Property | Benefit for Robot Fleets |
|:---------|:-------------------------|
| **Non-Interactive** | Robots don't need to coordinate; fire-and-forget updates |
| **Additive Homomorphism** | Server sums encrypted gradients from 100s of robots in O(n) |
| **Post-Quantum** | Resistant to Shor's algorithm (future-proof) |
| **Noise = Privacy** | The same noise that secures LWE also provides ε-DP |

## ❓ 9. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### General

**Q: Can I use TensorGuard without FHE (N2HE)?**
A: Yes. You can disable encryption in `ShieldConfig` and rely solely on Differential Privacy and Sparsification for a "lightweight" mode suitable for trusted internal networks.

**Q: Does it support PyTorch/Jax/TensorFlow?**
A: Yes. The `VLAAdapter` is framework-agnostic. It works with any tensor format that can be serialized to NumPy arrays.

**Q: What VLA models are supported?**
A: Currently optimized for OpenVLA/Pi0 architectures. Any model with a gradient-returning training step can be adapted.

### Security

**Q: How does this handle "Catastrophic Forgetting"?**
A: The **Evaluation Gate** prevents global updates causing high KL-Divergence from the base model, ensuring the fleet never "forgets" foundational skills.

**Q: Is the key generation cryptographically secure?**
A: Yes. TensorGuard v2.0 uses `secrets`-seeded CSPRNG (PCG64) for all cryptographic operations including LWE key generation and Skellam noise sampling. For enterprise deployments requiring FIPS 140-2 compliance, integrate with an HSM (Hardware Security Module) via the KMS integration. See [docs/HSM_INTEGRATION.md](docs/HSM_INTEGRATION.md).

**Q: What happens if a robot is stolen?**
A: The `KeyManagementSystem` allows immediate key revocation. Once a key is revoked, future `UpdatePackage` submissions from that hardware ID are rejected.

### Performance

**Q: Does encryption slow down inference?**
A: No. TensorGuard only operates during the **fine-tuning/learning** phase. The standard inference path (Vision → LLM → Actions) remains untouched and runs at full VLA speed.

**Q: How much bandwidth does it save?**
A: Random Sparsification (Rand-K) typically achieves a **50x reduction** (e.g., 15MB → 300KB per round). This is critical for robots operating on cellular/satellite links.

## 📚 14. Engineering Deep-Dive & FAQ

For a complete technical breakdown of all subsystems, see **[docs/ENGINEERING_DEEP_DIVE.md](docs/ENGINEERING_DEEP_DIVE.md)**.

### Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>🔐 Q1: How does TensorGuard ensure my robot data stays private?</strong></summary>

**A:** TensorGuard uses a multi-layer privacy approach:

1. **Local Processing**: Raw demonstration data never leaves your robot. Only compressed, encrypted gradients are transmitted.

2. **N2HE Encryption**: Gradients are encrypted using Learning With Errors (LWE) lattice-based cryptography. The server aggregates encrypted values using **homomorphic addition**—it can sum ciphertexts without ever decrypting them.

3. **Differential Privacy**: Skellam noise is added to gradients, providing (ε, δ)-DP guarantees. Even if an attacker intercepts the encrypted gradients, the noise masks individual contributions.

4. **Sparsification**: Only the top 1-5% of gradient values are transmitted, further reducing information leakage.

**Result**: The aggregation server only ever sees encrypted, noisy, sparse gradients—never raw observations or actions.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>📡 Q2: How much bandwidth does TensorGuard use?</strong></summary>

**A:** TensorGuard achieves **50x compression** compared to naive gradient transmission:

| Stage | Compression Ratio | Description |
|:------|:------------------|:------------|
| Raw Gradients | 1x | ~15 MB for Pi0 LoRA |
| After Sparsification | 100x | Random 1% selection (Rand-K) |
| After Quantization | 4x | 32-bit → 8-bit |
| After gzip | 2x | Dictionary compression |
| **Final Package** | **~300 KB** | Ready for LTE/Satellite |

This makes TensorGuard viable for bandwidth-constrained deployments like agricultural robots, mining equipment, or satellite-connected vessels.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🧠 Q3: What is FedMoE and why does it matter?</strong></summary>

**A:** **FedMoE (Federated Mixture-of-Experts)** is our architecture for multi-task federated learning.

**Problem**: Standard FedAvg assumes all robots are doing similar tasks. But a picking robot and a welding robot should update different parts of the model.

**Solution**: FedMoE routes gradients to task-specific **expert blocks**:

```
Task: "Pick up the blue block"
   → visual_primary (42%)  ← Objects, shapes
   → language_semantic (25%) ← "pick", "blue"
   → manipulation_grasp (18%) ← Grasping
   → visual_aux (15%)       ← Color
```

The server aggregates each expert separately, preventing parameter interference between dissimilar tasks.

**Configuration**: See [docs/EXPERT_ROUTING.md](docs/EXPERT_ROUTING.md) for customization.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🔑 Q4: How do I set up HSM/KMS for enterprise key management?</strong></summary>

**A:** TensorGuard supports three cloud KMS providers via the dashboard UI:

**Option 1: AWS KMS**
1. Create a CMK in AWS KMS Console
2. Dashboard → Settings → KMS Provider → AWS KMS
3. Enter CMK ARN: `arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456:key/abcd-1234`
4. Click "Test Connection" → Save

**Option 2: Azure Key Vault**
1. Create Key Vault + RSA key in Azure Portal
2. Dashboard → Settings → Azure Key Vault
3. Enter Vault URL: `https://myvault.vault.azure.net`
4. Enter Key Name: `tensorguard-key`

**Option 3: GCP Cloud KMS**
1. Create Keyring + CryptoKey in GCP Console
2. Dashboard → Settings → GCP Cloud KMS
3. Enter Project, Location, Keyring, Key

For code-based configuration, see [docs/HSM_INTEGRATION.md](docs/HSM_INTEGRATION.md).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>⚡ Q5: What are the hardware requirements?</strong></summary>

**A:** 

| Component | Minimum | Recommended |
|:----------|:--------|:------------|
| **Robot Edge** | | |
| CPU | 4 cores | 8+ cores |
| RAM | 8 GB | 16+ GB |
| GPU | None | NVIDIA with CUDA |
| Storage | 10 GB | 50 GB |
| **Aggregation Server** | | |
| CPU | 8 cores | 32+ cores |
| RAM | 32 GB | 128 GB |
| Network | 100 Mbps | 1 Gbps |

**Note**: The encryption/decryption operations are CPU-bound. For maximum throughput on the aggregator, use a machine with many cores and AVX-512 support.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🛡️ Q6: Is TensorGuard post-quantum secure?</strong></summary>

**A:** **Yes.** TensorGuard uses **LWE (Learning With Errors)** encryption, which is:

1. A **NIST PQC finalist** algorithm family
2. **Resistant to Shor's algorithm** (unlike RSA/ECDSA)
3. Based on the hardness of finding short vectors in lattices

Our default parameters (n=1024, q=2^32) provide **128-bit post-quantum security**, equivalent to AES-128 against a quantum adversary.

For higher security (SOC2 Type II, HIPAA), use `security_level=192`.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🔄 Q7: How does error feedback work?</strong></summary>

**A:** Error feedback ensures no gradient information is lost due to sparsification:

```python
# Round N
clipped = clipper.clip(gradients)
sparse = sparsifier.sparsify(clipped)  # Keep random 1% (Rand-K)
residual = clipped - sparse            # The 99% we dropped

# Round N+1
gradients += residual                   # Add back what we dropped
```

**Memory Pruning (v2.0)**: Residuals for parameters not seen in 10 rounds are automatically discarded to prevent unbounded memory growth.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>📊 Q8: How do I monitor training progress?</strong></summary>

**A:** Use the **TensorGuard Dashboard**:

```bash
tensorguard dashboard --port 8000
# Open http://localhost:8000
```

**Overview Tab**:
- Encrypted submissions count
- Bandwidth saved (MB)
- Latency breakdown (Train/Compress/Encrypt)
- Expert weight distribution

**Settings Tab**:
- Adjust ε (privacy budget)
- LoRA rank
- Sparsity percentage
- KMS/HSM configuration

**Usage Tab**:
- Historical bandwidth analytics
- Aggregation success rates

**Versions Tab**:
- Model version history
- Quality metrics per deployment
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🚨 Q9: How does Byzantine attack protection work?</strong></summary>

**A:** TensorGuard uses **Median Absolute Deviation (MAD)** for outlier detection:

```python
# For each gradient dimension:
median = np.median(all_client_gradients)
mad = np.median(np.abs(gradients - median))

# Reject if:
if np.abs(gradient - median) > 3 * mad:
    reject_as_outlier()
```

**Protection Against**:
- Label-flipping attacks
- Gradient scaling attacks
- Byzantine clients sending arbitrary values

**Quorum Enforcement**: Aggregation requires at least 2 valid clients. Single-client updates are rejected.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🔧 Q10: How do I customize expert routing for my domain?</strong></summary>

**A:** Create a custom `expert_config.yaml`:

```yaml
experts:
  surgical_precision:
    blocks: [10, 11]
    keywords:
      - incision
      - suture
      - vessel
      - tissue
    gate_threshold: 0.20

  haptic_feedback:
    blocks: [12, 13]
    keywords:
      - force
      - resistance
      - compliance
```

Load in Python:
```python
adapter = MoEAdapter()
adapter.expert_prototypes["surgical_precision"] = ["incision", "suture", ...]
adapter.routing["surgical_precision"] = [10, 11]
```

See [docs/EXPERT_ROUTING.md](docs/EXPERT_ROUTING.md) for advanced learned gating.

<details>
<summary><strong>🤝 Q11: What is the complete technology stack I need?</strong></summary>

**A:** You need distinct stacks for the **Local Fine-Tuning** (which you control) and the **Federated Orchestration** (which TensorGuard handles).

#### 1. Local Fine-Tuning Stack (Your Responsibility)
This is the code that actually runs on the robot to compute gradients.
*   **Deep Learning Framework**: PyTorch (recommended) or JAX/TensorFlow.
*   **Model Library**: Hugging Face `transformers` (for OpenVLA/RT-2) or `timm`.
*   **PEFT Library**: Hugging Face `peft` is highly recommended for implementing LoRA/QLoRA adapters efficiently.
*   **Training Loop**: A standard supervised learning loop (forward pass -> loss -> backward).
*   **Hardware**: An edge GPU (NVIDIA Jetson Orin / RTX 4090) capable of holding the model + one batch in memory.

#### 2. Federated Learning Stack (TensorGuard's Responsibility)
This is the infrastructure that moves and secures the updates.
*   **Privacy Engine**: `tensorguard.core` (Handles Gradient Clipping, DP Noise, N2HE Encryption).
*   **Communication Layer**: Built-in gRPC/HTTP2 client for secure, bidirectional streaming.
*   **Aggregation Server**: `tensorguard.server` (Handles Outlier Detection, Secure Sum, Model Broadcasting).
*   **Management**: The **Dashboard** (HTML/JS) for fleet visibility.

**Workflow**: You write the "Local Fine-Tuning" code. You wrap it with the "Federated Learning" SDK.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>➕ Q12: How do I add more robots via the UI?</strong></summary>

**A:** You **do not** add robots via the UI. TensorGuard uses a **Zero-Trust "Push" Model**:

1.  **Provision the Robot**: Install the `tensorguard` SDK on your new robot.
2.  **Configure**: Point the robot's `tensorguard.yaml` to your Aggregation Server's IP (`server_address: "192.168.1.100:8080"`).
3.  **Authenticate**: Ensure the robot has the correct **Shared N2HE Public Key** (distribute this securely via your HSM/KMS).
4.  **Connect**: Start the client. It will automatically "phone home" and appear in the Dashboard's **Real-Time Fleet Telemetry** once authenticated.

The Dashboard is for **Observability** (monitoring active connections), not **Provisioning** (creating accounts). This prevents the central server from being a single point of attack for hijacking fleets.
